# A-Scalable-Serving-System-for-a-Deep-Neural-Network
Serving a Deep Neural Network (DNN) efficiently on a cluster of Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) is an important problem. When we think about ML, we usually only think about the great models that we can now create. But when we want to take that amazing model and make it available to the world we need to think about all the things that a production solution requires, including scalability, consistency, modularity, and testability, as well as safety and security.
